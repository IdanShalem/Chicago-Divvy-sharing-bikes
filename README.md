# Chicago-Divvy-sharing-bikes
In this project, I analyze data from the database of Chicago Divvy sharing bikes in 2016. The database contains more than 70 thousand rentals. I analyze the data by consumers statistics and rentals statistics in order to examine the target audience and the consumer's behavior. I've made this project by using python.
